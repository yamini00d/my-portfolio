          <p>
            Hello, I am Yamini Duraisingam, a dedicated Software Engineer residing in Toronto, Canada. <br>
            Currently, I am on track to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, <br>
            majoring in Software Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University in April 2024.<br>
            <br>
            I am interested in both hardware and software engineering. My expertise and interests span <br>
            across various facets of technology, including web development, cloud computing, and machine <br>
            learning. Additionally, I possess a strong proficiency in Microcontroller Programming, Embedded <br>
            Hardware-Software Design, and Digital Circuit Design. <br>
            <br>
            I bring valuable experience from my previous role as a Software Engineering Intern at Andie. <br>
            Beginning as a skilled back-end developer, I progressed to assume responsibilities as a versatile <br>
            full-stack developer. During my time, I played a pivotal role in the development of an e-commerce <br>
            platform for the company. <br>
